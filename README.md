# VLM Instructions
Run the requirements.txt, it may not work on the full runtime of the requirements file, but everything needs to be installed for the application to work correctly.

To run the actual file just run python3 main.py

P.S, it does take a long while to actually run, enjoy a drink while you wait for your prompt response.
