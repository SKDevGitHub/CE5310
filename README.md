# Park-Robot-Lab
Here will be the test/practice code for the Dr. Park robot lab.

Right now I am splitting the code by categorizing it into 3 main categories.
- Movement
- Vision
- Speech

The first main goal I would like to have is to create working AI models for these three modes.
- Speech for communication with other people
- Vision to understand surroundings
- Movement to interact with surroundings

Please try and keep any new code categorized into the folders. More organization will be added later as the project gets more complex.
